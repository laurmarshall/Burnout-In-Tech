During a period when I wasn't doing well, my manager didn't feel like they could ask about how I was doing, or about what kind of support would be helpful. They were relieved when I (without a direct ask from them) let them know that I was not actively suicidal. They talked through some options with me, and expressed that it would be okay for me to take a leave-of-absence for a mental illness (with proper documentation). \\n\\nI navigated setting up intermittent FMLA leave on my own, with the LOA company that our company outsources all LOA-related info to. Several months into this, my manager and my future manager let me know that HR is hustling to make an intermittent-LOA policy because no one else in the company of 10,000+ people has ever taken FMLA leave on an intermittent basis. I let them know that $outsource_company has been tracking my leave, and that they had no problems setting it up under the existing FMLA policies. \\n\\nI'm seriously considering negotiating down to part time work because I don't want to spend my energy navigating the medical/legal parts of the healthcare/leave system.
