## Background and Motivation
Burnout is the result of excessive and prolonged stress in the workplace. It impacts you physically, emotionally, and mentally. It has a negative impact on work performance as well.
Coined in the 1970â€™s by American psychologist Herbert Freudenberger, it is a relatively new concept. A general dfinition of burnout is the result of excessive and prolonged stress in the workplace. The impact it can have on a person includes symptoms such as lower productivity, fatigue, insomnia, detached relationships, vulnerability to illness, and many more. Burnout was recently recognized as a medical diagnosis, Burnout Syndrome, in 2019.
## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Hypothesis Testing
## Conclusion
Both the perceived importance of mental health and physical health share the same peak. Outside of that value, physical health had a higher rating for all values to the right of the middle and mental health had a higher rating for all values to the left of the peak. In general this dataset brings up more questions than answers. The high rate of null values made this dataset not ideal for hypothesis testing.

## Questions and Future Study
How can we obtain a dataset with limited absence of responses to generate a hypothesis test? There were too many imbalanced classes
How can a measurable value be established for burnout?
What are action responses that can be implemented with better data?
